The rapid adoption and use of CRISPR-Cas9 to edit genes is entirely due to its being presented in a reproducible way, with a [detailed supplemental section](http://science.sciencemag.org/highwire/filestream/593726/field_highwire_adjunct_files/0/1225829.Jinek.SM.revision.1.pdf) in the main paper that provided all the information needed to try it at home.\n",

    "## Best practices for project organization\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is no “best” way to lay out a project, there are some general principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Treat data as read only:** This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them interactively (e.g., in Excel), where they can be modified, means you are never sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection. It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as “read-only”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleaning:** In many cases your data will be “dirty”: it will need significant preprocessing to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful. This task is sometimes called “data munging”. Storing these scripts in a separate folder, and creating a second “read-only” data folder to hold the “cleaned” data sets, can prevent confusion between the two sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Treat generated output as disposable:** Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should all be able to be regenerated from your scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of different ways to manage this output. Having an output folder with different sub-directories for each separate analysis makes it easier later. Since many analyses are exploratory and don’t end up being used in the final project, and some of the analyses get shared between projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Separate function definition and application:** One of the more effective ways to work with R is to start by writing the code you want to run directly in a .R script, and then running the selected lines (either using the keyboard shortcuts in RStudio or clicking the “Run” button) in the interactive R console.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your project is in its early stages, the initial .R script file usually contains many lines of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their own functions. It’s a good idea to separate these functions into two separate folders; one to store useful functions that you’ll reuse across analyses and projects, and one to store the analysis scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Control your code:** *Version control* is a program that \"tracks changes\" to a set of files over time, so that you can go back in time to any previous \"version\" of your work. We will learn the details of *version control* later in this lab (see section below). "

    "\n",
    "So far, we have only described (in some depth) how to keep track of changes and versions of your own files, which is a very useful skill. However, the main strength of Git/GitHub is the capability of doing collaborations. You can have multiple people, in different continents, working on the same code. This can be complicated and is beyond the scope of this lab. However, here we will give you a small introduction to collaborations in Git/GitHub and we'll point you to a 5 min YouTube video that shows you how this in done in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of collaborations lay in something called **\"Pull Requests\"**!!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you own a repository and want to upload some changes, you would simply do a **push**. However, if you do not own a repository, you cannot **push** to it (thank goodness! Can you imagine if anybody could just push (i.e. upload) stuff to your repositories?). Luckily, there is another alternative, a command called **Pull Request**, where you can politely ask the owner of a repository to take a look at your suggested changes and, if all looks good, then the owner can **\"pull your requested\"** changes and **merge** them with his/her main repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, between the **Pull Request** and the **merge** there are a lot of discussion done in GitHub's built-in commenting tool. There whole process looks a bit like the diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"workflow.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"workflow.png\" width=\"800px\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to be able to open **Pull Requests**, you need to either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have access (granted by the owner) to create branches in the repository you want to suggest changes to\n",
    "2. or, you can **Fork** the repository you want to suggest changes to (which can be any public repository in GitHub)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Fork** is similar to a **Branch**. However, **Forks** are independent copies of the original repository. If the original repository is deleted, all its **Branches** would be deleted too, but any **Fork** would remain in existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at this 5 minute YouTube video from [Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp), where he demonstrates a **Fork** and **Pull request** in a simple real-life collaboration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ\n",
